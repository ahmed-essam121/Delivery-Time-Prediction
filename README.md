🚀 Exciting News: Delivery Time Prediction Project!

I’m excited to announce the completion of my latest project on Delivery Time Prediction using Linear Regression, with deep analysis conducted in Python and visualized using Power BI!

📌 Highlights of the Project:

🔍 Built a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate delivery times based on distance and other factors.
📊 Performed comprehensive data analysis to identify factors influencing delivery times.
🎨 Created interactive visual dashboards in Power BI to uncover insights and enhance decision-making.
This project gave me valuable hands-on experience in combining data modeling with visualization for real-world problem-solving. I’m excited to continue building my expertise in data analytics and predictive modeling!

💡 Looking forward to connecting with professionals interested in data science, logistics, or predictive analytics. Let’s collaborate or exchange ideas!
